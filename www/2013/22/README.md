Dark Sunrise
===

An homage to the golden era of music vis, by visualizing the visualizer.

* Fourier transforms
* Beat detection
* Field advection
* Color mapping
* Frequency painting

The interesting part is `js/geo`. It's a prototype of a MathBox-style geometry pipeline. JavaScript expressions are streamed into `FloatArrays`, uploaded into textures, and rendered using displacement in a BufferGeometry's vertex shader.

The Geiss-clone is located in `js/fx/advect.js` and `shaders/advect.glsl.html`.

Controls:
* Q - Unlock camera
* WASD - Move camera
* Mouse down - Rotate camera
* < > - Back / Forward 5s (causes audio desync)
